### CDV
What I've learned in college so far (WIP)
## Projects I took part in but are not in this repository
  https://github.com/squally13/cat_dog_classification_model <br/>
    Project fully explained in readme of the page.
    
  https://github.com/squally13/Gejm <br/>
    A simple video game made in Unity to grasp the ideas of GameDev and working in Unity with C# and Github
  

# Basics of programming in C++
  Few simple programs used to solve mathematical and basic programming problems (Factorial, greatest common divisor, lenght of a string, etc.)

# GameDev Documentation Basics
**Game Design Macro**
| Game Title | Time of day/Weather/Mood | Brief description | Player Mechanics | Player Goal | Design Goal | Emotional Beat | Characters encountered | Objects encountered | Other assets needed | Audio notes |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Level 1 | Night, Stormy | Introduction level, presenting basic mechanics | Movement, Flashlight System, Interactivity with objects | Unlock the door | Make the player as anxious as possible and prepare them for what is coming | Anxiety, Confusion, Fear | Spy (The player character), Monster (if you fail) | Table, Radio, Window, Door | Flashlight | Movement sounds, radio messages, typing code sounds |
| Level 2 | Night, Stormy |  | Movement, Flashlight System, Interactivity with objects | Unlock the door | Same puzzle but more challenging to find clues | Anxiety, Confusion, Fear | Spy (The player character), Monster (if you fail) | Table, Radio, Window, Door | Flashlight | Movement sounds, radio messages, typing code sounds |

**One Page Design Document**
  (see file OPDD in GameDev Folder)

# Object oriented programming
  Few simple console programs tackling some typical excersises (matrix, FIFO types, Validation for passwords)

# To be added:
  upload of the files in Object oriented programming (missing exercises) <br/>
  other projects made with Python and libraries <br/>
  software engineering module (diagrams) <br/>
  lowpoly projects <br/>
  database systems <br/>
  (...) <br/>
