    A simple video game made in Unity to grasp the ideas of GameDev
  

# Basics of programming in C++
  Few simple programs used to solve mathematical and basic programming problems (Factorial, greatest common divisor, lenght of a string, etc.)

**Game Design Macro**
| Game Title | Time of day/Weather/Mood | Brief description | Player Mechanics | Player Goal | Design Goal | Emotional Beat | Characters encountered | Objects encountered | Other assets needed | Audio notes |
|------------|--------------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Level 1 | Night, Stormy | Introduction level, presenting basic mechanics | Movement, Flashlight System, Interactivity with objects | Unlock the door | Make the player as anxious as possible and prepare them for what is coming | Anxiety, Confusion, Fear | Spy (The player character), Monster (if you fail) | Table, Radio, Window, Door | Flashlight | Movement sounds, radio messages, typing code sounds |
| Level 2 | Night, Stormy |  | Movement, Flashlight System, Interactivity with objects | Unlock the door | Same puzzle but more challenging to find clues | Anxiety, Confusion, Fear | Spy (The player character), Monster (if you fail) | Table, Radio, Window, Door | Flashlight | Movement sounds, radio messages, typing code sounds |
